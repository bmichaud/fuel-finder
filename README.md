Capstone AWS cloud project 
This project was created based largely on the AWS lab project, https://github.com/awslabs/elasticache-geospatial-public-bikes.git.

It was done purely as an internal training exercise and is not for public consumption. The YAML files for cloud formation will not work (were not used) and neither was the stream processor except as a reference.
